  <h1>FEMA GO Help Desk Practice Tickets &amp; Example Responses</h1>

  <div class="ticket">
    <h2>Ticket 1 – Login Issue</h2>
    <p class="user">User: “Hi, I’m trying to log into FEMA GO but it says my credentials are invalid. I reset my password yesterday, and it still won’t work.”</p>
    <div class="response">
      <p><strong>Example Response:</strong></p>
      <p>Hi [User],</p>
      <p>Please make sure you are signing in at 
        <a href="https://go.fema.gov">https://go.fema.gov</a>. 
        Since you reset your password recently, try clearing your browser cache/cookies and logging in again. 
        Also double-check that you’re entering your registered email address as the username.</p>
      <p>If the problem continues, I can reset your account or escalate to the FEMA GO support team to verify if your account has been locked. Let me know after trying these steps.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="ticket">
    <h2>Ticket 2 – File Upload Error</h2>
    <p class="user">User: “I’m applying for a preparedness grant, but every time I try to upload my budget document, FEMA GO gives me an error. The file is about 12 MB, in Excel format.”</p>
    <div class="response">
      <p><strong>Example Response:</strong></p>
      <p>Hi [User],</p>
      <p>The upload error may be due to the file size limit in FEMA GO — the system generally allows files up to [_]MB. 
        Since your budget document is [_]MB, I recommend either compressing the file or saving it as a smaller PDF version.</p>
      <p>Also, please make sure the file name doesn’t contain special characters (like # or &amp;), and that you’re uploading from a supported browser such as Chrome or Edge.</p>
      <p>If you still encounter the error after trying these steps, please let me know the exact error message you see, and I’ll escalate this to our FEMA GO technical team.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="ticket">
    <h2>Ticket 3 – Browser Problem</h2>
    <p class="user">User: “The submit button doesn’t show up at the bottom of my application page. I’ve tried refreshing a few times but it’s just not there.”</p>
    <div class="response">
      <p><strong>Example Response:</strong></p>
      <p>Hi [User],</p>
      <p>This may be related to browser compatibility. FEMA GO works best in [recommended browsers]. Please try accessing FEMA GO in one of those browsers, clear your cache/cookies, and reload the application page.</p>
      <p>If the submit button still does not appear, let me know and I can escalate the issue to our technical support team.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="ticket">
    <h2>Ticket 4 – Missing Grant Award</h2>
    <p class="user">User: “Our city was awarded a FEMA grant, but I don’t see it in FEMA GO under my account. Could you check why?”</p>
    <div class="response">
      <p><strong>Example Response:</strong></p>
      <p>Hi [User],</p>
      <p>It’s possible the grant has not yet been linked to your FEMA GO user account, or that your role doesn’t currently have the right permissions to view it. Could you please confirm your role in the system (Applicant, Subrecipient, Reviewer, etc.)?</p>
      <p>If your role looks correct and you should have access, I will escalate this issue to the FEMA GO technical team so they can verify and update your account permissions.</p>
